      <h2>About QueerFeministGeeks:</h2>
      <p>This assembly is home to all queer/feminist/trans*/intersectional people who want to meet each other, hang out, feel safe, and make friends. You can bring yourself, drinks, food, or anything you like. If there are enough of us, it should be easy to make this assembly possible & wonderful. So please join and help to realize this! We will discuss about what it's like to identify as queer in tech, as a feminist, as an intersectional person concerned with oppression in a predominantly white-male-heterosexual context.</p>

      <p>This assembly is meant to be a safer space. Safer spaces can be understood as spaces of non-oppression, non-hierarchy, and non-discrimination, whether explicit, through a community agreement, or implicit through the sharing of values. They enable members of a group to flourish, empower themselves and create community. They are also about pushing boundaries to confront all forms of sexism, racism and ableism, among others, as these are values we internalize in our societies growing up. Safer spaces are an opportunity to learn more about ourself and others to confront these internalised oppression.</p>

      <p>If you do not self-identify as queer and/or feminist, you are allowed to attend but please be mindful to not take up all the space for yourself. Some of us may be available to explain things and answer questions, but we suggest you also try to educate yourself in easily accessible resources such as the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">Geek Feminism Wiki</a>. If you're not sure, it may be nicer to ask people what's their preferred pronoun ("Are you a boy or a girl?" is not an accepted question). Read our <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Geek_Feminism_Wiki">Code of Conduct.</a></p>
